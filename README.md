# Task2_DataVisualization_Storytelling
This repository contains Task 2 of the Data Visualization and Storytelling project. Using Power BI and the Superstore sales dataset, I created an interactive dashboard to highlight key business insights. The goal was to communicate data-driven findings clearly and effectively through visual storytelling.
